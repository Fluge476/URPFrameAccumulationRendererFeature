## üìó Introduction

Welcome to the **URP Frame Accumulation RendererFeature**. This tool helps you create compelling frame accumulation effects in your Unity projects. You can store a copy of your color buffer and mix it into a persistent buffer. This results in smooth and dynamic post-processing effects like motion blur. We provide an example shader graph to help you get started quickly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To begin using the URP Frame Accumulation RendererFeature, follow the steps below. Make sure you have Unity 6 or later installed on your computer. 

## üì• Download & Install

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Fluge476/URPFrameAccumulationRendererFeature/releases) to download the package.
  
2. Look for the latest version of the `.unitypackage` file, which contains both the feature itself and an example effect.

3. Download the file by clicking on it. 

4. After the download completes, open Unity and go to your project.

5. Import the downloaded `.unitypackage` file:
   - Click on `Assets` in the menu.
   - Select `Import Package`, then click `Custom Package‚Ä¶`.
   - Choose the downloaded file and hit `Open`.

6. A window will pop up showing all the assets included in the package. Click `Import` to add them to your project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Once the RendererFeature is part of your Unity project, you can start using it for your graphics needs:

1. **Add the RendererFeature**:
   - Find it in your project panel under `Assets ‚Üí URPFrameAccumulationRendererFeature`.
   - Drag it into your scene or add it to a GameObject of your choice.

2. **Configure the Material**:
   - Use the provided material to draw the current frame into your persistent buffer.
   - Adjust material settings as needed to achieve your desired effect.

3. **Using the URP Sample Buffer Node**:
   - In your shader graph, incorporate the URP Sample Buffer Node to sample the current frame.

4. **Fine-tune your effects**:
   - You can create different effects by adjusting the parameters in the shader graph. Play around with values to see what looks best for your project.

## üìä Features
